    <h2>Analyzing Privacy Policies of Menstrual Cycle Tracking Apps Using LLMs</h2>
    <p>For my thesis, advised by Brian Kernighan, I am exploring privacy policies of menstrual cycle tracking apps utilizing LLMs. This topic aligns with my work on eir as the protection of health data such as menstrual cycle symptom data is of the utmost importance, especially after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Data recorded by these menstrual cycle tracking apps can be used against women in court as it is possible to detect pregnancy and abortions through the data collected, potentially leading to prosecution. I believe that women should have the right to privacy and protection of this data, but oftentimes people do not analyze the privacy policies of apps they utilize, leading to unwanted exposure of data. Through utilizing LLMâ€™s to analyze the privacy policies of existing menstrual cycle tracking apps, I am developing a system to rate the apps in terms of data security and privacy as well as policy language complexity. </p>
    <p>Through my work I am also exploring how to utilize LLMs to produce a consistent and reliable analysis of these privacy policy documents. Once I do so, I will be able to determine which existing mobile apps have the strongest privacy policy practices and also whether these policies have language complexity levels that are comprehensible for the general public. </p>
    <p>By the end of my analysis using LLMs I will have an understanding of the best practices to protect this data and implement it within the mobile app I am developing for eir for optimal security. </p>
