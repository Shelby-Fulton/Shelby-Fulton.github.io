    <h2>eir</h2>
    <p>Two Electrical Engineering students and I at Princeton co-founded eir, a hardware and software startup built by female athletes for female athletes. Women are often trained as if they are no different than men, but there is one key difference, the menstrual cycle. Something that is often considered taboo to discuss and often ignored completely yet has such a large impact on athletic training and success. Since January of 2024, the three of us have been working together to produce a sports wearable tailored specifically for women and mobile and desktop applications to help track athletes training alongside menstrual cycle symptoms. This enables us to provide athletes with personalized recommendations on how to optimize their recovery, nutrition, training, and more based on their symptoms and where they are in their menstrual cycle. I dedicated the summer of 2024 to eir and was responsible for the development of the front end of both the mobile and desktop applications which I developed using React Native and TypeScript. Below are screenshots of the apps. While they are not available on the app store yet, we will be beginning our pilot run during this upcoming semester and will likely deploy them for the public by the end of the academic year. </p>
    <p>Below is a screen recording that walks through what an athlete would see when using eir for a training session.</p>

    <p>Below are some screenshots from the webapp I developed meant for coaches to be able to track their team's training metrics.</p>
